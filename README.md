# Temporal-Information

In "SurveyTemporalinfo.ipynb" you will find some information I had researched on how to extract temporal information from text. I had then gone on to compare temporal information extraction with basic spacy followed by that using spacy with roberta as a transformer. The performance with roberta was better - in the sense it could pick out dates in any form eg. "04.10.2022" and also relevant time period information like "Q2" which normal spacy could not do.
